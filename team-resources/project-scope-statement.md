##PROJECT DETAILS:

**Project Justification:** In the spirit of UI development, this Hackathon is intended for student teams to create a UI framework.

**Project Description:** Each student has agreed to make a set amount of UI elements using CSS, Sass, HTML, and JavaScript.

**Project Objective:** To create at least 20 elements by March 5, 2017, both standard and innovative.

**Required Deliverables:** 12-column grid, typography, lists, forms, tables, buttons, modals, scrollspy, tabs, accordion, cards, carousels, pagination, and one innovative element from each teammate.

**Constraints/Risks:** Some teammates have limited knowledge and are here for the experience, and therefore may not be able to produce as many elements. Additionally, some members have time constraints. A risk is the introduction of new teammates at last minute.
