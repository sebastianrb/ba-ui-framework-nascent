        <h3>Requirements and Notes</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ripple effect can be set on most any element that can
             receive a click event, <strong>as long as it is non-statically positioned.</strong> That requirement is one of two reasons that there
              is another version of this effect ( ripple-body-child ) which does
              not have that requirement.
            </li>
            <li>In order for the ripple effect to be set on an element, the
             element must be given a <code>class="ripple-element"</code>.
            </li>
            <li>You must also include the ripple.js, and ripple.css files in
             your application for the effect to be applied.</li>
            <li>NOTE: with this version of ripple, if and element receiving the
              ripple effect has an accessibility outline on focus, that outline
              will expand with the scaling of the effect. For this reason, there
              is another version of this effect ( ripple-body-child ) which does
              not have this side-effect.
                <br>Other than that, this method works as expected.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Defaults</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The default color for the ripple effect is white with
             transparency - <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)</code>.
             <br>You can customize the color with any valid hsla, or
              rgba color - see "Customizations" below.
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>default</strong> effect will:
              <br> - be circular;
              <br> - emanate from where the mouse was clicked, and extend beyond
               the boundaries of the element to which the effect was applied;
              <br> - terminate in a size twice that of the largest dimension of
              the width and height of the element to which it is applied;
              <br>If you're comfortable with CSS properties, you can
              easily modify the scale property to produce different effect sizes
               and elliptical shapes by changing the values and number of
                parameters for the scale property in ripple.js.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Customizations</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> you can specify a custom hsla, or rgba color by including
              the custom data attribute
               <code>data-ripple-color="hsla(h, s%, l%, a)/rgba(r, g, b, a)"</code>
                 to the element on which the effect is to be applied.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Effect Clipping:</strong> you can specify that the effect be clipped, i.e., not extend past the boundaries of the element to which the
              effect will be applied, by simply adding the custom data attribute
               <code>data-ripple-clip="true"</code> to the element on which the
                effect is to be applied.</li>
          </ol>
